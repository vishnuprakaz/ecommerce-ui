**It is essential to understand the unique features and limitations of various frameworks, as they are available on different platforms and have distinct terms and conditions. Please consider this information when making a purchase decision.**

- When purchasing a framework or code from a specific platform, it is important to be aware that the license will only provide access to that particular framework or code. For example, purchasing the Berry Angular Theme from CodedThemes will grant access to the Angular code only, and it will not include access to other web frameworks. It is crucial to ensure that the license matches your specific needs before making a purchase.

- It is important to note that the licensing terms and pricing for frameworks and code can vary depending on the platform it is being purchased from. This means that the same framework or code may have different costs or usage restrictions on different platforms. It is important to compare the different options and carefully review the licensing terms and pricing before making a purchase.

- CodedThemes and partners provide technical support for all themes purchased from different platforms. It is important to note that this support may have certain limitations or exclusions, so it is recommended to carefully review the support policy before making a purchase.
