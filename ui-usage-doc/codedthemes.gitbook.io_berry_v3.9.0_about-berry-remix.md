Berry React Remix Dashboard Template

We're thrilled to announce that the React [Remix](https://remix.run/) version of our beloved Berry Dashboard Template is now available! With Remix, users can focus on crafting beautiful UIs and let the web standards take care of the rest, delivering a fast and resilient user experience.

> It's important to note that the Remix version of Berry is a **complementary** version, meaning that we won't be able to provide **full technical support**. We'll do our best to assist you in any way we can. We're committed to making sure that you have the best possible experience with our product and appreciate your understanding.

Furthermore, we've kept the Berry React Remix version as a minimal version with limited pages and functionality.We recommend trying out the [**demo**](https://berrydashboard-remix.fly.dev/) before making a purchase decision to ensure it fits your needs. Thank you for choosing the Berry React Dashboard Template, and we hope you enjoy using it!
