# AI Agent Backend Implementation Approach - Team Guide

## üéØ Project Vision & Concept

### Revolutionary UI Control System
We are building a groundbreaking proof-of-concept where an AI agent can control a complex e-commerce user interface through natural language conversations. This represents a paradigm shift from traditional click-based interactions to conversational UI automation.

### Core Innovation
**Users speak naturally, AI controls the interface automatically.**

Example: User says *"Show me red handbags under $100"* ‚Üí AI navigates to products page, applies color filter for red, sets price filter to $100 maximum, and displays results - all without the user clicking anything.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture Philosophy

### Separation of Concerns
- **AI Agent Backend**: Handles natural language understanding, intent recognition, and generates structured tool calls
- **Frontend**: Executes tool calls to manipulate the UI components in real-time
- **Communication Layer**: Streams events between AI and UI for seamless interaction

### Event-Driven Architecture
The system operates on real-time event streaming where the AI agent progressively sends both conversational responses and UI control commands as it processes user requests.

## üß† AI Agent Responsibilities

### Natural Language Processing
Your AI agent needs to:
- Parse user intent from conversational input
- Identify actionable requests that require UI manipulation
- Generate appropriate tool calls to accomplish user goals
- Provide natural conversational responses alongside functional commands

### Tool Call Generation
Transform user requests into structured function calls that the frontend can execute. Each tool call represents a specific UI action with clearly defined parameters.

### Progressive Response Streaming
Rather than waiting for complete processing, stream responses in real-time to create a dynamic, engaging user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Function Calling Framework

### Tool Definition Structure
Each available tool follows a consistent JSON schema format with three main components:

**Tool Identity**: Name and description of what the tool accomplishes
**Parameter Schema**: Structured definition of required and optional parameters
**Validation Rules**: Type constraints, enums, and value limitations

### Example Tool Schema
```json
{
  "name": "manage_products",
  "description": "Search, filter, sort and display products in Berry e-commerce",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "action": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": ["search", "filter", "sort", "clear_filters"],
        "description": "Product management action"
      },
      "filters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "color": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}},
          "price_max": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0}
        }
      }
    },
    "required": ["action"]
  }
}
```

### Available Tool Categories
- **Navigation Tools**: Page routing and section navigation
- **Product Management**: Search, filtering, sorting, display controls
- **Cart Operations**: Adding, removing, updating shopping cart items
- **UI Control**: Modal dialogs, theme changes, component interactions
- **User Notifications**: Success messages, error alerts, informational updates
- **Comparison Tools**: Product comparison functionality
- **Wishlist Management**: Save and manage preferred items
- **Checkout Flow**: Multi-step purchase process control

## üì° Server-Sent Events (SSE) Streaming Protocol

### Event-Based Communication Model
Your backend should establish an SSE connection that streams multiple event types as the AI agent processes requests. This creates a real-time, progressive interaction experience.

### Event Type Categories

**Text Chunks**: Progressive delivery of conversational responses
**Function Calls**: Structured commands for UI manipulation
**Thinking Events**: Processing status updates to show AI working
**Function Results**: Outcomes of executed UI actions
**Completion Events**: End-of-stream indicators with summary data
**Error Events**: Failure notifications with recovery suggestions

### Event Structure Pattern
Each streaming event follows a consistent format containing:
- Unique event identifier for tracking
- Conversation context for session management
- Event type classification for proper handling
- Timestamp for sequencing and debugging
- Event-specific data payload

## üé¨ Interaction Flow Examples

### Simple Product Search Flow
**User Input**: *"Find me gaming laptops"*

**AI Processing Sequence**:
1. Stream thinking event: "Understanding your request for gaming laptops..."
2. Stream text chunk: "I'll search for gaming laptops for you"
3. Stream function call: Navigate to products section
4. Stream function call: Apply search query for "gaming laptops"
5. Stream text completion: "Here are the available gaming laptops!"
6. Stream completion event with execution summary

### Complex Multi-Action Flow
**User Input**: *"Show me red handbags under $100 and add the first one to my cart"*

**AI Processing Sequence**:
1. Stream thinking event: "Analyzing your request for red handbags..."
2. Stream text chunk: "I'll find red handbags under $100"
3. Stream function call: Navigate to handbags category
4. Stream function call: Apply color filter for red
5. Stream function call: Apply price filter maximum $100
6. Stream text chunk: " and add the first one to your cart"
7. Stream function call: Add first result to cart
8. Stream function call: Show success notification
9. Stream text completion: "Done! Added Coach handbag to your cart."
10. Stream completion event with action summary

### Error Handling Flow
**User Input**: *"Buy that expensive watch"* (when no watch is currently visible)

**AI Processing Sequence**:
1. Stream thinking event: "Looking for the watch you mentioned..."
2. Stream error event: "I don't see a specific watch you're referring to"
3. Stream text response: "I don't see a specific watch on your screen. Could you navigate to a watch or tell me which watch you'd like?"
4. Stream completion event with error context

## üéØ Function Call Generation Strategy

### Intent Recognition Patterns
Your AI should identify these common user intent patterns:
- **Navigation Requests**: "Go to", "Show me", "Take me to"
- **Search Actions**: "Find", "Look for", "Search for"
- **Filter Applications**: "Red ones", "Under $100", "In stock only"
- **Cart Operations**: "Add to cart", "Remove", "Update quantity"
- **Comparison Requests**: "Compare", "Show differences", "Which is better"

### Parameter Extraction Logic
From natural language, extract structured parameters:
- **Colors**: Red, blue, black ‚Üí ["red"] or ["blue", "black"]
- **Price Ranges**: "Under $100" ‚Üí {"price_max": 100}
- **Quantities**: "Two of them" ‚Üí {"quantity": 2}
- **Categories**: "Handbags" ‚Üí {"category": "handbags"}

### Multi-Step Planning
For complex requests, break down into sequential tool calls:
1. Navigation to appropriate section
2. Application of filters or search terms
3. Execution of actions (add to cart, compare, etc.)
4. User feedback and confirmation

## üîÑ Response Streaming Best Practices

### Progressive Enhancement
Start streaming text responses immediately while processing function calls in parallel. This creates the impression of immediate responsiveness.

### Chunking Strategy
Break conversational responses into logical chunks that align with function call execution timing. Stream text that explains what's happening as actions execute.

### Error Recovery
When function calls fail, immediately stream error events followed by helpful text explaining what went wrong and suggesting alternatives.

### Context Awareness
Maintain conversation context across multiple exchanges. If a user says "add it to cart" after viewing a product, the AI should remember which product they're referencing.

## üìä Example API Request Format

### Incoming Chat Message
```json
{
  "message": "Show me red handbags under $100",
  "conversation_id": "conv_123456",
  "user_id": "user_789",
  "session_id": "session_abc123",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Outgoing Event Stream Examples

**Text Chunk Event**:
```json
{
  "event_id": "evt_001",
  "conversation_id": "conv_123456",
  "event_type": "text_chunk",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:01Z",
  "data": {
    "chunk": "I'll find red handbags under $100 for you",
    "is_complete": false
  }
}
```

**Function Call Event**:
```json
{
  "event_id": "evt_002",
  "conversation_id": "conv_123456",
  "event_type": "function_call",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:02Z",
  "data": {
    "call_id": "call_001",
    "function": "manage_products",
    "parameters": {
      "action": "filter",
      "filters": {
        "color": ["red"],
        "price_max": 100
      }
    },
    "reasoning": "Applying red color and price filters as requested"
  }
}
```

## üö® Critical Success Factors

### Real-Time Performance
Events should stream with minimal latency. Users expect immediate feedback when they speak to the AI agent.

### Function Call Accuracy
Tool calls must precisely match the frontend's expected parameter formats. Invalid parameters will cause UI actions to fail.

### Natural Language Quality
Conversational responses should sound natural and explain what's happening without being overly technical.

### Error Handling Robustness
When things go wrong, provide clear explanations and recovery suggestions rather than generic error messages.

### Conversation Context
Maintain conversation state to handle follow-up requests like "add another one" or "show me more of those."

## üé™ Advanced Scenarios

### Multi-Product Operations
**User**: *"Compare the iPhone 15 and Samsung Galaxy S24"*
**AI Strategy**: Navigate to comparison view, add both products to comparison, display side-by-side analysis

### Contextual Follow-ups
**User**: *"What's good about this one?"* (while viewing a specific product)
**AI Strategy**: Identify currently viewed product from UI context, provide specific feature highlights

### Cart Management
**User**: *"Remove the red shirt but keep everything else"*
**AI Strategy**: Identify red shirt in cart, remove only that item, confirm remaining items

### Checkout Assistance
**User**: *"I'm ready to buy these"*
**AI Strategy**: Navigate to checkout, guide through payment process, confirm order details

## üìà Success Metrics
